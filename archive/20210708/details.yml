# Introduction
intro: >
  I have more than 15 years of corporate experience in Australia and internationally through a variety of senior roles in tech companies and startups. I have worn many hats and can successfully lead Technical and Product teams as a Team Lead, Technical Lead, Engineering Manager, or Product Manager. I help teams build better products with a scalable growth, and quality-driven mindset. Sometimes I just do all the things. I enjoy working in small teams with fantastic people, building valuable products, on interesting technology, in the right culture. I prefer small startups or growth teams inside wider organisations where I can have an outsize impact.
